      <description>I decided that my first blog post should be about something that gave me the &amp;lsquo;wow&amp;rsquo; feeling - and I immediately knew that it has to be the Schröder–Bernstein theorem.

After hours of failed attempt, I thought I might be missing something trivial and decided to google it.</description>
